My dotfiles.

## Deps (probably incomplete):
- i3-gaps
- picom (still compton in most distros)
- polybar
- polybar-spotify-git
- feh
- zsh
- zsh-syntax-highlighting

**Note:** My zshrc puts the line editor in Vim mode.
If you don't want that, change the line that starts with `bindkey -v` to `bindkey -e`.
